**📌 AI-Based Recommendation System**

**📝 Project Description**


This project implements an AI-Based Recommendation System using Java. 

The application generates personalized item recommendations for users based on historical preference data.

It applies collaborative filtering techniques to analyze user-item interactions and predict items that a user may be interested in.

The system reads structured preference data (user ID, item ID, rating) and processes it using a recommendation engine to produce meaningful suggestions.

**🎯 Deliverable**


✔ A Java program


✔ Working recommendation engine


✔ Personalized recommendations generated from input data

**⚙️ Objective**


To design and implement a recommendation engine that:


Analyzes user preference data


Identifies similarity between users or items


Predicts unseen items for a given user


Generates ranked recommendations



**🧠 Working Principle**


The system loads user-item rating data from a file.


It processes the data using collaborative filtering techniques.


The engine calculates similarity between users/items.


Based on similarity scores, it predicts new items for a user.


The system outputs recommended items along with predicted scores.



**🚀 Features**


Personalized recommendations.


Collaborative filtering approach.


Scalable and modular structure.


Console-based output.


Lightweight and efficient implementation.



**🛠 Technologies Used**


Java.


Recommendation Algorithms (Collaborative Filtering / Slope One).


File Handling.


Basic AI Concepts

**✅ Conclusion**

The AI-Based Recommendation System successfully generates personalized recommendations using user preference data.

The system applies collaborative filtering techniques to predict relevant items for users.

It demonstrates the practical implementation of a working recommendation engine in Java.

The project highlights the importance of data analysis and similarity computation in AI-driven systems.

The recommendation engine improves user experience by suggesting unseen but relevant items.
